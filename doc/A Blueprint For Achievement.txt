A Blueprint For Achievement


Winners are truly a different breed of people who believe in going far beyond what any average person will settle for.
They are willing to do what others won’t and make the necessary sacrifices that it may take to get there.

	Believe while others are doubting.

	Plan while others are playing.

	Study while others are sleeping.

	Decide while others are delaying.

	Prepare while others are daydreaming.

	Begin while others are procrastinating

	Work while others are wishing.

	Save while others are wasting.

	Listen while others are talking.

	Smile while others are pouting.

	Commend while others are criticizing.

	Persist while others are quitting
